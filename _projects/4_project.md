## **Abstract**
● Developed a hybrid mathematical model by integrating data-driven models for
combustion and heat transfer with a physics-based model for boiler dynamics to
control water level and pressure by dynamically adjusting combustion parameters
based on changes in fuel type and ambient conditions
● Implemented SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) with ADAM optimizer to
improve model parameters
● Created the codebase in Python for the control system to maximize performance
and minimize human interference in operations
