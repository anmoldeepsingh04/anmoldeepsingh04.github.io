## **Abstract**

The FMAE-FKDC (Formula Kart Design Challenge) is a premier Go-Kart design and racing competition organized by the Fraternity of Mechanical and Automotive Engineers (FMAE) for university students. The event serves as a platform to showcase technical expertise, innovation, and teamwork in designing and fabricating high-performance Go-Karts.

Participants have to follow strict design, safety, and performance guidelines while optimizing aerodynamics, chassis dynamics, and powertrain efficiency. The challenge included multiple phases, such as design evaluation, virtual presentations, and QnA on simulation tests. Teams were judged on innovation, cost-effectiveness, and real-world applicability.

<ul>
    <li>Designed, validated and tested a Go-Kart, ensuring compliance with all specified constraints, safety parameters and design requirements. </li>
    <li>Designed multiple chassis configurations using SolidWorks</li>
    <li>Conducted impact simulations using Ansys Workbench to optimize safety and performance</li>
    <li>Secured <p>1<sup>st</sup></p> Position and the highest points in FMAE-FKDC National Online Go-Kart Design Competition-EV Category</li>
</ul>
