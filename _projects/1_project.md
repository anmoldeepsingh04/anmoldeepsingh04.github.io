## **Abstract**

This project mainly investigate turbulent flames which are usually observed in the practical combustors. We need both turbulence and combustion/chemistry solvers to model turbulent flames. In this project initially we intend to develop an ANN model which will be used to predict the flame structure of CH4/H2 and/or CH4/H2O/N2 O2 flames. Further, the developed ANN model we will be interfaced with the opensource CFD solver i.e., OpenFOAM to investigate turbulent flames.

● Conducted numerical investigation of turbulent reacting flows using open-source
CFD solver OpenFOAM coupled with Flamelet Progress Variable Model
● Designed and trained an Artificial Neural Network to replace OpenFOAM-Flamelet
Progress Variable-based model to simulate and analyze turbulent flame dynamics
● Achieved significant reduction in storage space requirement compared to the
OpenFOAM-FPV model
