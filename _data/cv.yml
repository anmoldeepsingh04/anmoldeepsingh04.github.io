      value: An aspiring researcher in the field of Computational Engineering and Sustainable Methods. I am passionate about leveraging Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Deep Learning (DL), and Quantum Computing (QC) to develop energy-efficient models that help combat climate change. CFD allows me to simulate complex fluid systems with high accuracy, while DL helps uncover hidden patterns that traditional methods often miss. QC’s ability to process massive datasets—common in CFD—offers a way to push computational efficiency even further. By integrating these technologies, I aim to create smarter, more efficient models that optimize fluid systems, reduce energy consumption, and support global sustainability goals in clean energy and climate action.
