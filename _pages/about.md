You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it #in the `img/` folder. # Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements #by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` #and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. # Link to your social media connections, too.

The website is under developmet as I have recently taken up this project. Majority content on the website as of now is from a template that I am using for development.I am as excited as I am confused because Web-Development is something that I have never tried before but having my personal website has been a long-standing goal for me. Please check back by mid-February, the site will be up and running! 

Thank you, smile a little more and I hope you'll have a great day ahead!
