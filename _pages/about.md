Hi, I am Anmol, an Innovation Engineer at Thermax Limited, Pune and I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Goa, in 2022.

In my professional role, I am primarily working in the Alternate and Renewable Energy space. I have developed control systems for biomass fired boilers using data-driven techniques and worked on biogas and green hydrogen purification. I have been involved in the Detailed Design and Engineering phase of product development, focusing on integrating computational analysis into industrial projects. I am actively working on bridging the gap between computational modeling and practical engineering applications, particularly in energy, sustainability, and process optimization. 

My academic curiosity lies at the intersection of computational science and engineering applications, with a strong focus on CFD, HPC and simulations. I strongly believe that traditional mechanical engineering can be enhanced multifold by integrating **data-driven methods, such as machine learning, optimization algorithms, and computational modeling**, to improve design efficiency, predictive maintenance, and real-time process optimization. By leveraging **advanced analytics and AI-driven simulations**, we can push the boundaries of engineering innovation, enabling smarter, more efficient, and sustainable solutions across industries.

Outside my professional and academic endeavors, I'm an avid basketball player who loves delving into mathematics and exploring its profound influence on our understanding of the universe. From watching mathematical infotainment to pondering the Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics and the ultimate fate of Schrödinger's poor cat, my interests are deeply rooted in the objectivity of our world, curiosity, and critical thinking. I am also deeply engaged in reading about societal issues, all of which enrich my perspective and approach to engineering challenges.
